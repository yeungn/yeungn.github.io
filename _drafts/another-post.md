The application that I am going to show you is a apt listings scraper packaged up as a gem and published on rubygems.org. This is a very early release so ther may be some bugs that I may or may not have seen yet. 

Go ahead and install the gem by typing `gem install apt_finder`.

After the installation in done you can run the application by typing apt_finder.

Bugs: 

I found one of the listing giving me an error which killed the application. So here is what went wrong while grabbing data from apartmentfinder.com 

List of some things I will like to improve.

- listing was reprinting the list (fixed)
- 



- some of the listings are not returning the accurate bedroom type
- future iteration will include a fix for this.
