So here I am trying to write something without much editing while writing. I know I have a problem completing the task that I start or should I say that when it gets a bit tough I find myself losing interest. 

I don't know what my issue is and would like to find or figure out a way to overcome this challenge. I do wish that there was more of a beginner guides to writing.

I feel like I got myself into something very challenging. hat are those challenges? Let me list of some:

1. Non-verbal type of communivation (ie. emailing, blog, messaging type service)
2. (articulate) express my thoughts (always had an issue)
3. focus
4. finance
5. future
6. failure

this feels more like i am taking notes than writing, but let me try not to give myself an excuse to not write. I will continue to write and come back to this later and re-write. this is where i feel like i lack in skills nd confidence. speaking of confidence I have so many life confidence issue. i will make a list of things to work on.

I will try to write here about the recent projects that I have been working on in my virtual class. 

A bit about the class I am taking. The name of the class (I am calling it class because everyone I speak to assumes its a college) is called Flatiron School. This is not your traditional type of school. 

This class is all virtual and what that means is the class material is all online.

So one of the two project I want to write about today are: tic tac toe with AI and Apt finder.

I will start with Tictactoe. Tictactoe will be a Command line interface program. Command line interface also called CLI which I will be using from here on out is a program that come with most modern computers that is all text. What a poor explaintion of that command line tool. let me go and do a bit of reading and come back to write about this.

oops ended up on Slack reading other peoples messages. lurking.
 
 where was I? Oh yea reading up on what is a command line interface. its a text base program that a user or client use to issue commands to a program.

 So for the tictactoe program I am building this with a programming partner. what we will like to build is an interface that allows a user to play against a computer, comuter vs computer, user, vs user mode.

 Now that i think about it, its more writing and step that i imagined. 

 I am pretty much done with the program now, only thing is that the computer player is still pretty stupid. The computer doesn't how to win right now. He/she can block some hard coded moves meaning I wrote that in there instead of using logic or math.

 I am trying look for answers but reading other solution is not helping me right now. I wuld like to be able to writin it myself but can't. Then my mind starts to think, am I just too dumb this or my lack of education. 

 I have more than just one issue, wiritng is a main one. This issue that i have is effecting my progress in my learning to code journey and its a fear that I hope to overcome oneday soon er than later. 

 At this moment I am not sure if all of this attempt to read more books will help or just delay my progress. I listen to podcast regularly to help my understanding of specific topic and hoping that some of that personality will rub off on me.

I have a very short way of writing things out. How can I improve that? Is it my limited vocabulary that causes this? As I am writing this, another thought just came up. The lack of writing in my life ay have cause this. Now I just lost my train of thought. hm...

How do I ask if anyone wants to pair up for the duration of the program.








 now back to reading some class work.
