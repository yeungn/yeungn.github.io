What I am feeling today.

Day started off with my weekly appointment with my therapist. following that was the brunch at Galli for Steven's birthday. The brunch was I guess pretty cool.

Then at home while trying to code and go through some learn.co labs, Mom calls at around 8 pm or so and ask if she can drop by and drop off stuff for tomorrow appointment. How I want respond is why do you give me a last minute notice. why does everyone including my previous landlord like to do this to me?

Why do I mind?

My family to this day still does not know that my relationship with Karen has ended and has been like that since 2014. I am afraid to tell them. They are old and I really don't want to disappoint them. I wish I had a family that will not be quick to judge if I share my struggles. I am just hiding. It sucks! I beat myself up. All I really want at this moment is to just start all over again. I feel like I am a failure to my family and just want to be s person that can give to them.
