Hello World!

{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

Here I go again. My many attempts to write something useful on my dev blog.

Assuming you are using a Mac (I am currently using a iMac running Yosemite version 10.10.5)

Step 1. Open Terminal and run `gem install jekyll`

Step 2. Select a local directory or create one and then run `jekyll new name-of-folder`
