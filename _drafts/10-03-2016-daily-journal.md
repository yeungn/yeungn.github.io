Today as I am sitting here waiting for the day to go by as usual.

My mom is sitting here mumbling and mentioning that my brother was unemployed and dealing with issues. why do I feel like my family is so broken. What can I do to help? I dont want to add more burden to the family right now. I just want things to get better. I feel so useless that I spent all these years doing what exactly!! ? I feel like my mom is really sad right now.

WTF!!!

I know Mom means well. She offer to buy stuff with her card. She is still my Mom.

I need to get my shit together and provide and do better. This got me really sad.
