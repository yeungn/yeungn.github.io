Begining today, my goal is to start writing about my plans for the day and the next day.

Plans for today will be to finish up my assesment blog post and publish it for review for the project requirement.

Yesterday was my first day to start writing right after my session with Nicholas. I was planning to write about the soft opening of Zhiyu's restaurant soft opening and was going to go there and show my support for his restaurant. It didnt work out as planned. Gary was the person who invited me to the event and after I contcted him after my appointment with Nocholas, he didnt get back to till about 3 pm, so I deceided to clean up at home instead.

So I ended up meeting with Steven and David at 4pm and hung aroud the apartment and had a few whiskey till about dinner time.

My email to Nicholas in the morning following:

*Hi Nicholas,*

*My plans yesterday did not work out. The person who invited me to the soft opening did not make till later in that day.*

*So I decided to enjoyed a moment to organize my stuff I had laying out in my living space from cleaning out the garage. After that I met up with my cousin and friend for chat and coffee.*

*The night ended with a dinner and by the time I arrived at home I was too tired to do anything.*

*Today will be a better day for following up on my writing plans from the previous day.*

Before I thoughts get in the way, I hit the send email the way it is.
