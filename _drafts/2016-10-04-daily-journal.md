today I am starting to work with another classmate on the TTT with AI. Trying to explain how the code I have from the previous partner. Not understanding the code is slowing down my progress.

Redoing this lab to get a better understading of how the game play will work


I feel like I need to redo this TTT AI lab
  - explaining how the methods work

What do we want our program to do?

What I will like for the program to do 
  - launch and ask for the users input 

how to get better at describing a problem to someone else
how to improve with decribing the program logic to another person.
